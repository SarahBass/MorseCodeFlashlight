DESCRIPTION:Transmit morse code from your watch screen on a dark night while camping, hiking, or taking a night stroll!

INCLUDED:

This simple program includes a dictionary, a play button, and two morse code input buttons. While the morse code flashlight is playing, the program will display your GPS location, a 24 hour clock, and the current date. Click the SOS button on the start screen to go straight to S.O.S Message or click Start to create your own transmission.

DISCLAIMER:

Not intended as a life saving device. It helps to use this app if you already know Morse Code or use the SOS button feature. Each letter takes 2-3 seconds to transmit, which is slow by Morse Code standards. Seconds are the fastest refresh rate offered on Fitbit watch, which is why the code is slowly transmitted. Photosensitive users should not look directly into the flashing light.

USE:

Each play is limited to 9 letter messages which is played in real time on a loop. Swipe back to main menu to refresh and make a new code. Once the play button is started, it continues to loop until you exit manually, and you cannot enter a new code while it plays. This is for safety reasons so that accidentally don't change your message while transmitting.

Play your morse code on repeat, so that it catches the attention of someone far away. Loop for at least 60 seconds for best effect.

You can also input numbers which can tell someone how many people are in your party, what your GPS location is, or a phone number.

SETTINGS:

You can increase your screen's brightness settings under your watch settings to make the flashlight stronger. Turn on Always on Display and Change your screen timeout delay to 60 seconds for best results.

MORSE CODE GAME:

Try out the very simple learning game called 'Morse Code Game' to learn individual letters with less than 30 seconds play time.
